  <h3>Project:</h3>
  <p><b>Project Title: </b>Smart Warehouse Monitoring System Using IOT</p>
  <p><b>Description:</b> Developed a smart warehouse monitoring system utilizing IoT technology to improve efficiency and safety 
    within a warehouse environment. The system leveraged various sensors to monitor critical environmental conditions 
    (temperature, humidity) and potential hazards (fire, gas).
  </p>
  <p><b>Outcome:</b>Sensor data collection and transmission using GSM technology. Real-time monitoring of environmental conditions 
    and potential hazard. Alert generation upon exceeding pre-defined thresholds. Cloud-based data storage and visualization for 
    historical analysis using Thing View – Thing Speak viewer app.</p>
